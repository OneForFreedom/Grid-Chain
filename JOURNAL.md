# 11/7/25 - The start of an Era
Metaporphically. 

I started my 3rd week of fusion coding!!
(I wrote this journal on a google doc, but I didn't submit until now. I'm stupid like that.)
I'm thinking about haveing a max of 100mm^2 squares, aside from the keychain hole bit, that way, i can do a combination of 10x10 squares/ 20x20, its just really versitile. Hell if i want to, i can make it 2x2. or 1x1. :hs:

Since no time was done working towards projects. No time is logged.

P.S - I am aiming to make 30 keychains with 30 minutes in each of them!

Since it'll be 30 journal entries with 30 mins in each, I will only have title, image, and time.

Lest I say more, lets get started!!

## 1. Among us
   
Ehh what other idea would I have? I'm out of them.

Time taken 30 min.

## Revolt D: 

Windows Updated, which is really anoying, so now I'm forced to redo everything from scratch. I didn't even save my work. Now at first I made this:

<img width="1311" height="607" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cdc2df3-228a-4977-8936-2cc42d42f5e7" />

It was all extruded, took me like 2-3 hours, which is REALLY anoying because I didn't save that, so that crashed, so now I remade it, (I didnt extrude it, it looks identical to the image above) and that took me a good 2 hours, mainly cuz making each square takes like 15 mins. And I made 8 of them. You may ask why I didn't just copy and paste, and my reason to that is cuz if I do  try copy and paste, It just gets frozen for like 20 mins, then force crashes. So yea, anything repetative, has to be done repeatedly.

Time taken : 5 HOURS
TOTAL TIME TAKEN: 5.5 HOURS

## 1. Among Us AGAIN

Extruding every square, then joining them painstakenly took a very long time

I might make tetris next.

TT (Time taken) 1h
TTT (total time taken) 6.5h

## 2. Tetris

This took wayyyy longer then expected, I look like 2 hours making this. Yes I am indeed very very very inexperianced at cad.

TT: 2h
TTT: 8.5h

### To set the ruler straight.

The reason why the keychains are taking a long time is cuz I make the designs on a pixel art thing before actually making it, so it just takes a good bit longer. here's an example of me making one:
