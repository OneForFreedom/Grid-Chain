# 11/7/25 - The start of an Era
Metaporphically. 

I started my 3rd week of fusion coding!!
(I wrote this journal on a google doc, but I didn't submit until now. I'm stupid like that.)
I'm thinking about haveing a max of 100mm^2 squares, that way, i can do a combination of 10x10 squares/ 20x20, its just really versitile. Hell if i want to, i can make it 2x2. or 1x1. :hs:

Since no time was done working towards projects. No time is logged.

P.S - I am aiming to make 30 keychains with 30 minutes in each of them!
